When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Maybe when my computer is not around or broken.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because pull changes manually makes you have enough time to review your code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: sends the repository from other hithub to your own.
    Clones: download the repository from your hithub to your local computer.
    Branches: help you change the repository without changing the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It will help us to merge the new commits from the GitHub.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
	
	I will collaborate manually by copying and sticking, it will be harder.
    

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I will make changes in a separate branch when I need someone review my project, without changing my master. It makes it easy to communacate and make changes.
